## GIT CONFIGURATION üç¶

- Now that you have installed Git, go to your repository in Gihub and grab your credentials from there.

<br>

#### You will need:

- your **name** repo, mine is 'nadiamariduena': https://github.com/nadiamariduena

- Your **email** connected to your github account
- And the **password** connected to the account

<br>
<br>

##### The following commands will set your git commit username and email address:

```javascript
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
```

##### To verify the configuration changes, type:

```javascript
git config --list
```

##### Output

```javascript
user.name=Your Name
user.email=youremail@yourdomain.com
```

#### To Edit the .gitconfig from the GNU nano Editor:

```javascript
git config --global -e
```

- **Once you copy paste** that, you will see a window editor, inside the editor you will be able to edit it directly.

<br>

- Once you are done save the changes:

### Save File in Nano

- The **editor** will give you many options, one of these options is **^O(Ctrl + O)**

<br>

> **If you wish to save your current changes** to the file, **press** the ^O (**Ctrl + O**) combination. If you are editing a new file, you will be asked to give that file a name. This will save your current changes and nano will remain opened so you can continue making changes to the file.

<br>

### Save File with Backup

> Sometimes when editing a file, you may want to keep temporary copies of the same file just in case. You can use nano‚Äôs -B option, which will create backup of the file you are editing. You can use it in combination with the -C option to tell nano where to save those backups like this:

<br>

### Exit Nano Editor

> To exit nano, simply press ^X (Ctrl +X keys). If the file has not been previously saved, you will be asked to save the changes with yes/no or cancel the exit.
